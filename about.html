                            Southern California is my home, but somehow I ended up getting stuck in the northern part of the state.
                            I studied bioengineering at the University of California, Berkeley.
                            I worked at an immunotherapy startup immediately after graduation, focusing on improving downstream process development protocols.
                            UCSF was the next stop; there I studied the signaling networks of pediatric leukemias before returning to academia.

                                <li>I enjoy a lot of sports, but it's getting harder and harder to follow all my teams.
                                    I support the Los Angeles Lakers, California Golden Bears, San Francisco 49ers, Los Angeles Dodgers, Los Angeles Kings, Los Angeles Galaxy, and Arsenal Football Club.
                                <li>Before graduate school, I spent a fair amount of time climbing outdoors.
                                    These days, I am mostly scaling plastic holds.

                                <li>Board games are fun, particularly long strategic ones. I rarely have time to play them, but my current choice is
                                    <a href="https://www.mayfairgames.com/products/caverna">Caverna</a>. It's a farming simulation game starring cave dwarves.
                                    I am also looking for a copy of <a href="http://avalonhill.wizards.com/games/acquire">Acquire</a>, a much better hotel tycoon game than Monopoly (which is still quite entertaining).
                                <li><a href="http://emiliaspizzeria.com">Emilia's</a> makes the best pizza in the Bay Area.
                                    <a href="http://www.goldenboypizza.com">Golden Boy</a> is pretty great too. <a href="https://www.bantam1010.com">Bantam</a> and <a href="https://www.mentonerestaurant.com">Mentone</a> are my two favorite Santa Cruz
